    "By the end of this case, you will be familiar with various data visualizations like heat maps, line plots, strip plots, and box plots. You will also begin to develop a sense of which plots to use for displaying certain types of information. This will help you write better reports and communicate your ideas and analyses much more clearly to non-data professionals."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** Energy supply and demand is a hotly debated topic across world governments and political parties. You are an analyst for the Department of Energy (DoE), and are responsible for discerning patterns in electric power generation and consumption across different energy sources as well as across sectors of the U.S. economy in order to help drive government initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your boss would like you to answer the following question: **\"Given patterns in energy consumption across sectors and time, how should we allocate government resources towards nuclear electricity generation?\"** He needs to explain your findings to non-technical politicians so they can allocate resources appropriately across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You are given data in CSV format from the [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/index.php) (EIA) for both energy consumption and net electricity generation, where energy consumption is broken down by sector and electricity generation is broken down by source. In this case, you will explore relationships between energy consumption in the electric power sector and electricity generation from nuclear electric power; identify any patterns in energy usage and generation and how they change over time; and finally, use plots to determine which sectors consume the most energy and how this has evolved over time."

    "The consumption and generation data are each given on a monthly basis in ```data/energy_consumption.csv``` and ```data/electricity_generation.csv```. The dataset's contents and some useful characteristics to note about the data are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data/energy_consumption.csv` table:\n",
    "- Contains monthly energy consumption by sector for the U.S.\n",
    "- Energy consumption is the use of energy as a source of heat or power or as an input in the manufacturing process\n",
    "- Primary energy is first accounted for energy in a statistical energy balance, before any transformation to secondary or tertiary forms of energy\n",
    "- Total energy consumption in sectors consists of primary energy consumption, electricity retail sales, and electrical system energy losses\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data/electricity_generation.csv` table:\n",
    "- Contains monthly net electricity generation for all sectors in the U.S.\n",
    "- Net electricity generation is the amount of gross electricity generation less station use (the electric energy consumed at the generating station(s) for station service or auxiliaries)\n",
    "- Btu stands for British Thermal Unit\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns in the tables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MSN:** Mnemonic Series Names (see https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/sep_use/notes/use_a.pdf for more information)\n",
    "2. **YYYYMM:** The month of the energy use\n",
    "3. **Value:** The amount of energy consumed/generated\n",
    "4. **Column_Order:** The order of columns used in the official EIA reports\n",
    "5. **Description:** The description of which sector consumed/generated the electricity\n",
    "6. **Unit:** The unit of energy used for the value\n",

    "Although boxplots give you some insight into the distribution of the underlying data in each category, they are still relatively blunt instruments. For example, how is the data distributed within the interquartile range? Between the edges of the box and the whiskers? Since a boxplot is created from only five values, it cannot answer these fine-grained questions. However, a **strip plot** is able to combine a 1D scatterplot with a split by category to get an even more granular view of the data:\n",

    "\n",
    "We've done an extensive analysis of energy consumption and electricity generation trends over time and across sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered that there is a peak in energy consumption and generation in the summer months of the year, and as time has passed the gap between peak and non-peak consumption has widened. This may present a market opportunity for a power plant which has the ability to expand and contract capacity as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we saw that different sectors have very different energy consumption profiles. In particular, the electric power sector seems to be a significant driver of marginal demand. This means that the DoE might want to focus its efforts on reducing consumption in this sector or providing additional generation."

    "Data visualization is a powerful tool in the data professional's toolkit for effective data exploration and communication. It helps you find interesting trends in your data that you would otherwise not notice. It is also crucial when communicating your findings to non-technical persons. As such, it is an important skill for you to continue to practice and develop."
