    "**Business Context.** You are part of a civil society organization that tracks environmental metrics related to deforestation and forest quality across the United States. The data analytics team has been tasked with conducting an assessment of the possible conservation strategies for a protected forest in the state of California. As part of the research project, they need to establish some descriptive metrics of the forest's vertical stratification (which tree species belong to the canopy and which to the understory), species diversity, biomass, etc. This is important because if the trees in this specific location exhibit different physical characteristics than trees in the rest of California, the strategies to conserve them may need to be adjusted to account for these particularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** Your job is to **determine which tree species in the protected forest have heights that differ substantially from those species' average heights across the state of California.** From this, other members of the team will proceed to conduct species-specific surveys to further investigate the ecological conditions of the places where these trees are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You have been given a survey dataset that has data for 18 species from the protected forest. The sample contains 100 trees per species. The table that we will be working with has the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CN**: A unique tree identifier. Each tree in the survey has a number\n",
    "2. **HT**: Height of the tree in feet\n",
    "3. **SITREE**: The [site index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_index) (age-normalized height of the tree in feet)\n",
    "4. **common_name**: The tree species' common name\n",
    "5. **scientific_name**: The tree species' scientific name\n",
    "\n",
    "The case will proceed as follows: 1) we will look at census data from a reserve outside of California to illustrate the intuition behind the hypothesis tests we will be conducting, for which we will need to understand the population; and 2) we will conduct hypothesis tests on the forest survey data to answer our business problem."

Because of this, it is important that we look at **sampling distributions**. Contrary to the degenerate distribution of $\\mu$ (which only has one value), the sampling distribution of the sample mean has to be constructed using many values.

A good analogy is to the principle governing numerous judicial systems across the world: \"*[Innocent until proven guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence)*\".
