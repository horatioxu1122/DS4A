    "**Business Context.** You are a product manager for Airbnb. The travel industry has scaled by offering home sharing accommodations in crowded hotel districts near frequently-visited landmarks and attractions. Airbnb has enabled home sharing at a global scale and created a new category of travel. Instead of traveling like tourists and feeling like outsiders, guests can stay in neighborhoods where people live, have authentic experiences, live like locals, and spend time with locals in approximately 100,000 cities around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The executives would like to know **where and how the company should invest more marketing efforts to attract more hosts and guests**, taking into account the effects of COVID-19 on bookings across 10 markets and the major differences among those markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** We will use the publicly available and well-maintained dataset created by the Inside Airbnb advocacy group, which you can see [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). We will be looking at the data up to Q1 2021 for Bangkok, Cape Town, Mexico City, Istanbul, Hong Kong, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney and Rome."

    "## What is Product Management?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Management** is a rapidly-growing discipline and is essential for any company that provides out-of-the-box solutions for its customers. (This is in contrast to companies that provide customized solutions, although such companies still reap considerable benefits from product management best practices.) At such companies, **product managers (PMs)** are responsible for the defining the business strategy and feature definition for a product (or subcomponent of a product). The role may also include marketing, forecasting, and profit and loss (P&L) responsibilities. Product managers work closely with the Sales, Marketing, Design, Data Science, and Engineering departments (to name a few) in order to deliver the best possible product. Below is a diagram that shows how product management intersects with a few of the aforementioned departments:\n",

    "<img src=\"data/images/PMDSRoles.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",

    "The goal of the product is to provide value that our customers are willing to pay for. In order to do this though, we first need to *understand the domain*, which in our case is the market in which Airbnb's products operate. This should be the first thing that any competent PM (and really, any person that works with broadly-defined problems) ought to do."

    "\n",
    "At the start of COVID-10, Airbnb lost revenue from [cancelled/refunded bookings](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2701/extenuating-circumstances-policy-and-the-coronavirus-covid19), so it launched Online Experiences. This allowed hosts to create experiences from the comfort of their own home or on vacation and add an additional revenue stream. As we come out the other side of COVID-19, we want to reflect on the pricing on our flagship product (Stays) and consider a fee increase there due to the losses during COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct some online research for any competitive features or products, then select two of Airbnb’s competitors and compare their fee structures to Airbnb's structure. Are there any aspects where Airbnb can become more competitive on pricing? Come up with 2-3 recommendations."

    "We may be tempted after conducting all of the above market research to begin outlining a solution to the problem that Airbnb's business leaders have posed. After all, isn't it clear that there are opportunities to: 1) increase fees but also; 2) increase incentive programs? Not so fast! All of the potential solutions so far are financial in nature, whereas in reality guests and hosts may care more about other aspects of the hospitality experience. It is therefore crucial to next *undestand our users* (both guests and hosts) and conduct *user research* in order to determine what matters to them and therefore what levers we can pull.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods available for conducting user research, from user interviews to moderated user testing to A/B testing to automated data collection. Here, we will focus on *user interviews* (i.e. talking directly with hypothetical users to gather anecdotal insights that could be informative of a larger pattern) as it requires the least infrastructure to get going with, but in practice high-quality user-focused organizations will utilize all of the aforementioned methods (and more!)."

    "1. Work with your team to to form any hypotheses, then formulate your questions so that the answers could help validate or invalidate those hypotheses.\n",
