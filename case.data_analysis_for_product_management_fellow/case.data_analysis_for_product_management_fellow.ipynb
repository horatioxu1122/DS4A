    "**Business Context.** You have been working with the Product Manager (PM) as a Product Data Analyst at Airbnb. The PM is looking to launch a strategy to increase the supply of hosts, Luxe properties, and Plus properties. To prepare for this presentation to executive stakeholders, they need more insight into the number of hosts by location, nightly rates by location, and how Superhost status may drive bookings, nightly rates, or instant book properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The executives have asked the PM to determine in which of 10 markets the company should invest more marketing efforts. You need to provide an analysis to the PM so that they can effectively partner with the Marketing team to increase the supply of hosts. In particular, they want to increase supply via targeting properties/hosts that may qualify as a Luxe/Plus product. Recall from the previous case that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Luxe](https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-luxe-reimagines-luxury-travel/) was launched when Airbnb found that bookings for properties that cost over \\\\$1,000 a night increased 60\\% after 2018\n",
    "* [Plus](https://www.airbnb.com/plus) was launched to provide travelers the guarantee of hotel-quality design and hospitality. It includes a \"selection of only the highest quality homes with hosts known for great reviews and attention to detail\", verified by a third-party inspector\n",
    "* For existing targeted marking campaigns, checkout the [Made Possible by Hosts campaign](https://news.airbnb.com/made-possible-by-hosts/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** You have been given the [Airbnb Listings and Review Summary Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), which contains Airbnb data up to Q1 2021 for Bangkok, Cape Town, Mexico City, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney and Rome. The columns that you will be working with are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Location**: The city where the property is located.\n",
    "* **host_is_superhost**: Whether the host of the property is a superhost (`t`) or not (`f`).\n",
    "* **property_type**: The type of the property.\n",
    "* **number_of_reviews**: How many reviews the property has received.\n",
    "* **review_scores_rating**: The review score that the property has received.\n",
    "* **instant_bookable**: Whether the property can be booked on short notice (`t`) or not (`f`).\n",

Let's try to figure out what these boundaries are."

    "\n",
    "The results from this exploratory analysis can certainly give your team some insight on what could be done to drive up the supply of hosts, Luxe properties, and Plus properties. We saw that Paris, New York, and Sidney are the locations with more listings, which may reflect the fact that they are more attractive to tourists and travelers than other destinations. It seems that those locations are the ones where you should be focusing your efforts. We also saw that being a Superhost or having Instant Book have the potential to increase customer engagement, but since we discovered that Superhosts do not necessarily charge more than ordinary hosts, we could say that we have mixed results here. Finally, the most expensive property types are those where the customer can rent the entire house, apartment, or villa. This is an interesting market segment, some of the properties may only be eligible for Luxe since only a proportion of guests presumably are able to rent high-end properties, i.e., Villas, Boats and Bungalows and their supply is very limited. Entire homes and apartments are likely better suited for Plus but It could be a good idea to start sourcing new datasets to complement this one and thus gain a better understanding of the market."
