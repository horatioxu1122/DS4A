    "**Business Context.** You are an HR representative at a large financial services firm that sells a diverse set of products. In order to make these sales, the firm relies on a call center where sales agents make calls to current as well as prospective customers. The company would like you to analyze their data about the performance of their sales agents and determine who to promote/keep and who to cut.\n",
